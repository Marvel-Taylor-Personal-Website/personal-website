        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p class="hiking">Living in California, I've been fortunate enough to be able to hike some of the most beautiful trails in the Los Angeles area.  One of my absolute favorite trails to hike is Escondido Canyon Park in Malibu.  After a day of rain, you'll catch some of the most beautiful waterfalls at Escondido Canyon Park during your hike!  The scenery and view overlooking the ocean is definitely worth exploring if you enough the outdoors!</p>

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p class="traveling">Ever since I've been a child, I've loved to travel, road trips included!  Over the last couple of years, I've been more intentional about experiencing other places and cultures.  I've recently gone on my second cruise, taken a road trip to the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas!  Taking trips has become a great form of self-care!</p>
